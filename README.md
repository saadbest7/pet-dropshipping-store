# Pet Dropshipping Store

This project is a starter Next.js application for an online pet dropshipping store. It uses Tailwind CSS for styling and provides a basic set of pages:

- **Home** – hero section and featured products.
- **Products** – list of available products.
- **Product Details** – detailed view with an Add to Cart button.
- **Cart** – view items selected for purchase.
- **Checkout** – placeholder page ready for payment integration.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Testing and Linting

```bash
npm test
npm run lint
```

This setup is ready for future integration with services such as Stripe or PayPal.
